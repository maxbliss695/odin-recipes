      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Transport yourself to Italy with just one bite of this classic Fettuccine Alfredo. Perfectly al dente fettuccine noodles are tossed in a creamy Alfredo sauce with hints of garlic and rich, balanced flavors from Parmesan and Romano cheeses.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          12 ounces fettuccine pasta
        </li>
        <li>
          1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast
        </li>
        <li>
          2 tablespoons butter
        </li>
        <li>
          2 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>
          1 cup heavy cream
        </li>
        <li>
          &frac14; to &frac12; freshly grated Parmesan cheese
        </li>
        <li>
          &frac34; to 1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese
        </li>
        <li>
          &frac12; teaspoon salt, plus more for pasta water
        </li>
        <li>
          &frac14; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
        </li>
        <li>
          Pinch of ground nutmeg (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
          Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil and cook the fettuccine until al dente, reserving a small amount of the pasta water before draining.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then cook it in a skillet with a little butter or oil over medium heat until fully cooked and lightly browned, and set it aside after slicing or shredding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in the same skillet over medium-low heat and add the garlic, cooking briefly until fragrant without allowing it to brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the heavy cream into the pan and stir, letting it gently simmer for a few minutes until it begins to thicken slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lower the heat and slowly stir in the grated Parmesan cheese until it melts completely and forms a smooth, creamy sauce, seasoning with black pepper and a small pinch of nutmeg if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the cooked fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat evenly, using some of the reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce if it becomes too thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the chicken to the pan and stir everything together, allowing it to warm through for one to two minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taste and adjust seasoning as needed, then serve immediately with additional Parmesan and optional parsley.
        </li>
      </ol>
