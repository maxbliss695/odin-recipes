      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Are you ready for a flavor explosion packed between a freshly toasted sesame bun? That’s exactly what this multi-layer, towering cheeseburger delivers: a perfectly grilled, juicy beef patty complemented by gooey sharp cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, tangy pickle chips, and the bold crunch of red onion slices. With layers of crunch, tang, and smoky perfection, the whole creation is lathered in sweet barbecue sauce, zesty mustard, and creamy mayo, tying everything together in a harmony that promises smiles with every bite.</p>
      <p>A burger like this is only made better by the sides you choose to indulge in alongside it. Opt for a heap of hand-cut fries or crunchy slaw for the textbook definition of comfort food. Whether prepared at a backyard barbecue or enjoyed as a cheeky weekend treat for one, this burger is sure to steal the show—bold, flavorful, full of attitude, and offering zero apologies.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          1 pound ground beef (or preferred amount)
        </li>
        <li>
          4 bacon slices (or preferred amount)
        </li>
        <li>
          2 slices cheddar cheese (or preferred amount)
        </li>
        <li>
          4 pickle slices (or preferred amount)
        </li>
        <li>
          2 red onion slices (or preferred amount)
        </li>
        <li>
          1 tablespoon mayonnaise (or to taste)
        </li>
        <li>
          1 tablespoon barbeque sauce (or to taste)
        </li>
        <li>
          1 tablespoon mustard (or to taste)
        </li>
        <li>
          1 sesame seed bun, toasted
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Shape the ground beef into one large patty (or two smaller ones), making a slight indentation in the center to help it cook evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Transfer to a paper towel&#45;lined plate to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the same skillet or on a grill, cook the beef patty over medium-high heat for 3&#45;4 minutes per side, or until it reaches your preferred doneness.
        </li>
        <li>
          During the last minute of cooking, place the cheddar slices on top of the patty and let them melt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lightly toast the sesame bun on the skillet or grill until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread mayonnaise and lay out pickle slices on the bottom bun. Add one cooked patty with melted cheese, spread barbeque sauce, then layer with second patty. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Finish with bacon slices and red onion. Cap off with the top bun.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy immediately while everything is hot, melty, and delicious!
