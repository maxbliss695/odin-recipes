# The Odin Project Foundations - Recipes Project

## A functional HTML only project to showcase foundational knowledge of basic HTML structure

This project is an early iteration using just HTML (no CSS/JS) that taught me the following:

* Adding a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to my local machine
* Utilize the Command-Line Interface (CLI) for making directories, HTML files, etc.
* Staging, restoring, and pushing commits to GitHub
* How to write the boilerplate HTML structure
* Create and maintain folders for images or other pages of a website outside of the homepage
* Add functioning links that navigate to other areas of a website
* Use proper heading hierachy in an HTML document
* Implement lists for displaying content like the ingredients or preparation steps
* How to make images more accessible with alt text
* Make use of HTML entities for adding in special characters
* Add height or width to images so they better fit on the page
